This repository is used to document and showcase my progress in studying the [Vulkan 3D Graphics Rendering Cookbook - 2nd Edition](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/3D-Graphics-Rendering-Cookbook-Second-Edition/tree/main) book, by Sergey Kosarevsky, Viktor Latypov and Alexey Medvedev.

Anything outside the mediumRare directory is the template the book uses and belongs entirely to the book authors. I used the template so I won't have to deal with CMake and dependency management.
